# MQST-QComputing

Project 1: design a Turing Machine to perform the factoring task.

The decision table of the different TM created are stored in .txt files and an environment to simulate the TM is taken from (https://sandipanweb.wordpress.com/2020/08/08/simulating-a-turing-machine-with-python-and-executing-programs/) and stored in TuringSimulator.ipynb

The complete TM (4.2prog_factoring.txt) has been built using intermediate TM to archieve smaller tasks, such as initialization or multiplying. Some of them can also be found in the project to help with a better understanding of the working method. Also a report with detailed information about the algorithm and the decision tables is in QComputingAssignment.pdf.
